# SQL Injection Vulnerability Demo

This repository demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability in a simple PHP application. The purpose of this demo is to educate developers about the dangers of SQL injection and how to prevent it.

## Disclaimer

**Warning:** This code is intended for demonstration and learning purposes only. Do not use this code in a production environment.

## Description

This demo consists of a PHP script that interacts with a MySQL database to retrieve product information based on user input. The script includes an HTML form where users can input a product name, and the script constructs a SQL query using this input.

Due to improper handling of user input, the script is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A malicious user can manipulate the input to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or compromising the database.

### Example Scenario

1. **Form Input**: The user enters `Product1` and submits the form.
   - **Constructed SQL Query**: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'Product1'`
   - **Result**: Displays the product with the name `Product1`.

2. **Form Input**: The user enters `' OR '1'='1` and submits the form.
   - **Constructed SQL Query**: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1'`
   - **Result**: Displays all products in the database because the condition is always true.

## Cloning the Repository
